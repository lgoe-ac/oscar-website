## Ideas

Here are some ideas for topics we *could* tackle.
What we actually will do will depend on who participates.

- G-modules: complete them
- group cohomology: which interfaces? application? -> application driven development
- orbit-stabilizer computations
- meataxe
- canonical maps
- more serialization
- work on Singular / Algebraic Geometry: complete <https://hackmd.io/hYXl0YRTSDKhqzfVSMpqsQ>
- using stabilizer chains to get better rewriting systems / normal forms
- ...
